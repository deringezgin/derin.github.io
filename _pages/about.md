I was born and lived in Izmir, Turkey until I was 18 when I came to the United States to study Computer Science and Data Science at Connecticut College. I am currently a sophomore at Connecticut College and expected to graduate on May 2027.

While pursuing my degrees in Computer Science and Data Science, I actively collaborate with my professors at Connecticut College on multiple research projects. At the same time, I work as a teaching assistant and grader for multiple Computer Science courses. I am also a member of the Computer Science Student Advisory Board as the Diversity Chair.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and the trumpet. Every semester, I take 1-1 instrumental music class in order to keep my skills up to date and to further explore my musical interests in both classical music and Jazz.
