Starting from my first year, second semester at Connecticut College, I have been actively collaborating with my professors on multiple research projects. I am a member of two different research labs at Connecticut College: [Autonomous Agent Learning Lab](https://oak.conncoll.edu/parker/research.html) and [Informatics Lab](https://www.informatics.digital.conncoll.edu).

## Autonomous Agent Learning Lab
**Advisors**: [Gary Parker](https://oak.conncoll.edu/parker/) & [Jim O'Connor](https://oconnor.digital.conncoll.edu/)

Since July 2024, I have been a member of Autonomous Agent Learning Lab which focuses on agent learning where agents are robots, robot simulations, and interactive game players. The lab focuses on leveraging evolutionary computation techniques to create these agents.

As a member of this lab, I have worked on two different research projects focusing on Game AI and Swarm Robotics.

### Sparrow Mahjong Game Agent with LSTM and CMA-ES

In this project, I worked on creating a game agent for the [Sparrow Mahjong](https://sugorokuya.jp/p/suzume-jong) game. To create the agent, I utilized Long-Short Term Memory Networks and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies. My current best agent can win 30% more games and score higher than the base-line agent.

The paper for this project is in the writing process and will be submitted to [IEEE COG 2025](https://cog2025.inesc-id.pt/).

### SwarmPAL

I am currently working on a project that focuses on evolving a controller for a swarm of E-Puck robots for a specific swarm robotics task. Currently I am experimenting with different controller structures (Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc.) and different evolutionary computation techniques (Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, etc.) to find the best controller for the task.

Depending on the progress of the project, we are aiming to submit a paper to [IEEE SMC 2025](https://www.ieeesmc2025.org/) to present our findings.
