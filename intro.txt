I am currently a rising-junior at Connecticut College, double majoring in Computer Science & Statistics and Data Science.

While pursuing my degrees in Computer Science and Data Science, I actively collaborate with my professors at Connecticut College on multiple research projects.
At the same time, I work as a teaching assistant and grader for multiple Computer Science courses. I am also a member of the Computer Science Student Advisory Board as the Diversity Chair.
